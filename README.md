# Volunteer-System-Section 
This project is a volunteer project for the Volunteering Department at the Islamic University in Gaza, 
and the previous system was a paper-based system that relied on the student going to all the institutions in which he would volunteer, 
which leads to wasting time and adding difficulties that the student could dispense with here.
The function of the system: 
It links all the partner institutions with the university within the system,
and the student can only log in through his university email and enter the suggestions or institutions and submit a volunteer request within this institution,
but here the request goes to the university
and the university responds to it in the affirmative or acceptance
